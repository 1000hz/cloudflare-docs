# Is Cloudflare a hosting provider?

Cloudflare is generally not a hosting provider[^1].

Instead, Cloudflare provides a wide array of services - [DNS](/dns/), [SSL/TLS](/ssl/), [CDN](/cache/), [Firewall](/waf/), and more - that improve your website and are compatible with a variety of hosting providers.

Cloudflare generally cannot remove content from the Internet that it does not host. For more information, refer to our [Abuse Hub](https://www.cloudflare.com/trust-hub/abuse-approach/).

[^1]: Meaning that Cloudflare does not generally provide definitive storage of online content.

## Where Cloudflare does provide hosting

When developers use Cloudflare Developer Platform products to build an application or website, the nature of those products mean Cloudflare is hosting online content.

These cases include (but are not limited to):

- [Cloudflare Images](/images/): A scalable image pipeline to store, resize, optimize, and deliver images in a fast and secure manner.
- [Cloudflare Pages](/pages/): A JAMstack platform for frontend developers to collaborate and deploy websites.
- [Cloudflare Stream](/stream/): Live and on-demand video streaming.
- [Cloudflare Workers Platform](/workers/platform/storage-objects/): Provides multiple storage options for developers.
