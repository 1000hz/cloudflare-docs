# Workers API

The Workers API is how you can interface with R2 using a JavaScript/TypeScript API on top of the
[Workers platform](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

The Workers platform lets you write applications that meet your users directly at the edge to meet
your client requests wherever they get generated without needing to manage any servers or worry
about scaling up your application. Write code, deploy with one click, and sit back as your application
is deployed worldwide within a minute with access to R2: a large object storage system with 0 egress
fees and scale to meet your business needs.

If you have an existing project using an S3 REST API, our [S3 compatibility layer](/r2/data-access/s3-api)
is an excellent way to migrate your existing project with minimal friction.
