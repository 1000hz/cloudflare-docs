However, we can change the problem space and make it work. This is done by restricting the computation to numbers of a fixed size by always dividing the result of a computation by big prime number and taking the remainder. This is called modular arithmetic. Taking an nth root in modular arithmetic is called the discrete logarithm problem and is considered a hard problem.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Now let\\u2019s go through a Diffie-Hellman handshake:\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"span\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"position\": \"relative\",\n      \"display\": \"block\",\n      \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n      \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n      \"maxWidth\": \"1228px\"\n    }\n  }, \"\\n      \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"span\",\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n    \"href\": \"/static/ebb889bb6ec4bd14a664b3f002b30ff8/45d84/ssl_handshake_diffie_hellman.jpg\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"display\": \"block\"\n    },\n    \"target\": \"_blank\",\n    \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n  }, \"\\n    \", mdx(\"span\", {\n    parentName: \"a\",\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"paddingBottom\": \"69.65317919075144%\",\n      \"position\": \"relative\",\n      \"bottom\": \"0\",\n      \"left\": \"0\",\n      \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAOABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDBf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHtojRVf//EABYQAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQQf/aAAgBAQABBQKlUr//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/AT//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/AT//xAAUEAEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAEBAAY/Al//xAAZEAADAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhMUH/2gAIAQEAAT8hqbqDyRFOzJIWj//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQ6w//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/ED//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/ED//xAAaEAEBAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAhMUFx/9oACAEBAAE/ECAWODiRX0wU5ZpH8K52dRmEHzf/2Q==')\",\n      \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n      \"display\": \"block\"\n    }\n  }), \"\\n  \", mdx(\"img\", {\n    parentName: \"a\",\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n    \"alt\": \"dh-handshake\",\n    \"title\": \"dh-handshake\",\n    \"src\": \"/static/ebb889bb6ec4bd14a664b3f002b30ff8/45d84/ssl_handshake_diffie_hellman.jpg\",\n    \"srcSet\": [\"/static/ebb889bb6ec4bd14a664b3f002b30ff8/fad94/ssl_handshake_diffie_hellman.jpg 346w\", \"/static/ebb889bb6ec4bd14a664b3f002b30ff8/f9df6/ssl_handshake_diffie_hellman.jpg 691w\", \"/static/ebb889bb6ec4bd14a664b3f002b30ff8/45d84/ssl_handshake_diffie_hellman.jpg 1228w\"],\n    \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 1228px) 100vw, 1228px\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"width\": \"100%\",\n      \"height\": \"100%\",\n      \"margin\": \"0\",\n      \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n      \"position\": \"absolute\",\n      \"top\": \"0\",\n      \"left\": \"0\"\n    },\n    \"loading\": \"lazy\"\n  }), \"\\n  \"), \"\\n    \")), mdx(\"h3\", {\n    \"id\": \"message-1-client-hello-1\"\n  }, \"Message 1: \\u201CClient Hello\\u201D\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Just like in the RSA case, the client hello contains the protocol version, the client random, a list of cipher suites, and, optionally, the SNI extension.
