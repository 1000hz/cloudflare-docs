The values returned can in theory be anything but in practice need to fit into well known types, such as addresses, mail exchanges, sever lists, free format text records etc. The keys consist of a name, type, and class. The name space is hierarchical (see below) and DNS information is “published” by Authoritative Servers. DNS Resolvers will locate the information requested by asking the appropriate authoritative servers by following the naming hierarchy from one Authoritative DNS server to the next one.

Thus `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`www.example.com.`}</inlineCode>{` consists of 4 labels `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`www`}</inlineCode>{` (leaf) `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`example`}</inlineCode>{` (domain) `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`com`}</inlineCode>{` (TLD) and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`.`}</inlineCode>{` (i.e., the root). Resolvers search by starting at the longest match of the labels, i.e., if it only knows about the root then, it starts the search there. If resolvers know about `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`.com`}</inlineCode>{`, they start there.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There are 13 root servers maintained by 12 different organizations. The root zone is maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which is a part of ICANN, and is published by Verisign which operates two of the root servers. The contents of the root zone is a list of the authoritative servers for each TLD, but not much else. Thus, if a root DNS server receives a query for `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`www.example.com`}</inlineCode>{` it will answer with what is called a referral to `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`.com`}</inlineCode>{` resolvers. The answer from the root server contains a set of records called NS (Name Server). These records list the nameservers which should have more information about the requested zone, i.e., the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`.com`}</inlineCode>{` servers.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Each one of the TLDs authoritative nameservers knows about the authoritative nameservers for the domains under them (`}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`example.com`}</inlineCode>{`, `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`cloudflare.com`}</inlineCode>{`, `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`google.com`}</inlineCode>{`, etc.). Following this downward, you will eventually get to the server that can answer queries about records for the name you are looking for.`}</p>\n    <p>{`DNS is the largest distributed delegated database in the world. Delegated means that each name can have a different authority that can maintain the information, and any changes are reflected in the DNS. For this reason, it’s important that resolvers don’t keep what they learn forever. Similarly, it’s important that busy resolvers can reuse the information they have fetched. This reuse of information is accomplished by placing a TTL on every DNS record which tells resolvers how long they can reuse the records to answer questions. When a resolver returns a cached value, it adjusts the TTL downward reflecting how long the data has resided in its cache.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"dnssec\"\n    }}>{`DNSSEC`}</h2>\n    <p>{`In the early 1980s, when DNS was designed, there was no consideration for strong security mechanisms in the protocol. Computers at that time were underpowered compared with today’s machines, public key cryptography was a relatively new concept and highly regulated, and the network was much smaller, with fewer participants who were relatively well known and trusted. As the network grew and evolved, DNS remained unchanged as an insecure and unauthenticated protocol.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In 1993, the IETF started a public discussion around how DNS could be made more trustworthy. Eventually, a set of extensions to DNS, called Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), were settled on, and formally published in 2005. These extensions replaced earlier proposals as a definitive way forward for securing DNS. Though it’s been almost a decade since this publication, DNSSEC is still far from mainstream adoption.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There are several catalysts pushing DNSSEC adoption, one of which is Dan Kaminsky’s `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-00924/0/CVE-2008-1447%3A-DNS-Cache-Poisoning-Issue-Kaminsky-bug.html\"\n      }}>{`cache poisoning attack from 2008`}</a>{`. This attack highlighted the significant trust issues in traditional DNS, and how DNSSEC is well positioned to solve them. However, even after a significant amount of work, adoption is lagging — there are several factors holding DNSSEC adoption back. Among them are network operators that prefer stability to complexity (for good reason). Another difficulty with DNSSEC adoption is that there is no universal consensus around whether DNSSEC is the right tool to secure the DNS.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The security extensions to DNS add protection for DNS records, and allow the resolvers and applications to authenticate the data received. These powerful additions will mean that all answers from the DNS can be trusted. Earlier you learned how DNS resolution starts at the root nameserver, and works down (e.g., for `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`www.example.com`}</inlineCode>{` it starts at the root server, then “com”, then “example.com”). This is the same way that trust is conferred via DNSSEC. The DNS root is the definitive root of trust, and a chain of trust is built to the root from any DNS entry. This is a lot like the chain of trust used to validate TLS/SSL certificates, except that, rather than many trusted root certificates, there is one trusted root key managed by the DNS root maintainer IANA.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The point of DNSSEC is to provide a way for DNS records to be trusted by whoever receives them. The key innovation of DNSSEC is the use of public key cryptography to ensure that DNS records are authentic. DNSSEC not only allows a DNS server to prove the authenticity of the records it returns. It also allows the assertion of “non-existence of records”.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The DNSSEC trust chain is a sequence of records that identify either a public key or a signature of a set of resource records. The root of this chain of trust is the root key which is maintained and managed by the operators of the DNS root. DNSSEC is defined by the IETF in RFCs `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4033\"\n      }}>{`4033`}</a>{`, `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4034\"\n      }}>{`4034`}</a>{`, and `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4035\"\n      }}>{`4035`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There are several important new record types:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`DNSKEY: a public key, used to sign a set of resource records (RRset).`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`DS: delegation signer, a hash of a key.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`RRSIG: a signature of a RRset that share name/type/class.`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`A DNSKEY record is a cryptographic public key, DNSKEYs can be classified into two roles, which can be handled by separate keys or a single key`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`KSK (key signing key): used to sign DNSKEY records.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`ZSK (zone signing key): used to sign all other records in the domain is authoritative for.`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`For a given domain name and question, there are a set of answers.

An RRSIG (Resource Record SIGnature) is essentially a digital signature for an RRset. Each RRSIG is associated with a DNSKEY. The RRset of DNSKEYs are signed with the key signing key (KSK). All others are signed with the zone signing key (ZSK). Trust is conferred from the DNSKEY to the record though the RRSIG: if you trust a DNSKEY, then you can trust the records that are correctly signed by that key.`}</p>\n    <p>{`However, the domain’s KSK is signed by itself, making it difficult to trust. The way around this is to walk the domain up to the next/parent zone. To verify that the DNSKEY for example.com is valid, you have to ask the .com authoritative server. This is where the DS record comes into play: it acts as a bridge of trust to the parent level of the DNS.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The DS record is a hash of a DNSKEY. The .com zone stores this record for each zone that has supplied DNSSEC keying information. The DS record is part of an RRset in the zone for .com and therefore has an associated RRSIG.
