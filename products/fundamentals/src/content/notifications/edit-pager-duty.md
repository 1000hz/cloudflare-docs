# Edit a PagerDuty connected service

You can only disconnect PagerDuty services. Be aware that disconnecting PagerDuty will disable notifications being sent to PagerDuty where currently configured. If other delivery destinations (like email) were selected, then those notifications will still be routed as configured. if PagerDuty was the only configured destination, disconnecting PagerDuty may result in a notification with no destination.
