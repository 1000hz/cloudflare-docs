# DNS over HTTPS

When you request to visit an application like `cloudflare.com`, your computer needs to know which server to connect to. Computers donâ€™t know how to do this name to address translation, so they ask a specialized server to do it for them.

Traditionally, these queries and replies are performed over plaintext, which means they are sent over the Internet without any kind of encryption or protection. This happens even when you are accessing a secured website. This has a huge impact on security and privacy, as these queries might be subject to surveillance, spoofing and tracking by malicious actors, advertisers, ISPs, and others.

To prevent this and secure your connections, you can send encrypted DNS queries to 1.1.1.1 over HTTPS. 

If you have a DNS over HTTPS compliant client, such as a router, copy one of the following URLs to configure a secure connection to 1.1.1.1 for Families. Refer to your client's manual to find how you can configure a manual DNS server.
