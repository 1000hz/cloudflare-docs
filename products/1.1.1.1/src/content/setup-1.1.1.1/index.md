# Setting up 1.1.1

By default, the DNS resolver your device uses depends on the network it is connected to. For example, this may be your [Internet providerâ€™s nameservers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) or the nameservers from the WiFi network on the coffee shop you are connecting to. 

To start using 1.1.1.1 for your DNS queries, you will need to change the DNS settings in your device or router. Before changing your DNS servers to 1.1.1.1, take note of any information already in place. This way, you can revert to using your previous DNS server should you want to.
