For example, if you have provided us a hostname `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`example.com`}</inlineCode>{` when registering a site, you can use the JS snippet from that site for `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`abc.example.com`}</inlineCode>{` and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`def.example.com`}</inlineCode>{` since they use the same root domain. When payload gets sent to the beacon endpoint, we validate the hostname with postfix matching, so if your domain shares the same root domain, that would work. `}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"can-i-use-automatic-setup-with-a-dns-only-domain-cname-setup\"\n    }}>{`Can I use automatic setup with a DNS-only domain (CNAME setup)?`}</h3>\n    <p>{`No, you can only use the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/web-analytics/getting-started#sites-proxied-through-cloudflare\"\n      }}>{`automatic setup`}</a>{` with JS snippet injection if traffic to your domain is proxied through Cloudflare (orange-clouded).`}</p>\n    <p>{`If you have a DNS-only domain, you will have to do a `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/web-analytics/getting-started#sites-not-proxied-through-cloudflare\"\n      }}>{`manual setup`}</a>{` instead.`}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"functionality\"\n    }}>{`Functionality`}</h2>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"can-i-see-server-side-analytics-by-url\"\n    }}>{`Can I see server-side analytics by URL?`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Web Analytics only displays client-side analytics.
