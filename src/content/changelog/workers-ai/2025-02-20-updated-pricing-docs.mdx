Updating Workers AI pricing page to reflect the latest models and pricing. Pricing is presented in units (tokens, audio seconds, etc) but will continue to be charged in neurons. The price per neuron remains the same as it has always has been at $0.011 per 1000 neurons. 

Having per-model pricing (instead of buckets) allows us to be more flexible on what models are charged. As we optimize each model, we can then pass on savings for that model.

Going forward, models will be launched in GA with pricing. Dashboard changes are coming to reflect usage in units and neurons. Docs redesign is incoming to show pricing directly on the respective model pages.
